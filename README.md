## HowTo

### Run the game

Simply run `build/index.html`

### Play

Use your mouse (on desktop) or finger (on mobile) to drag the snake's head
around the playing field filling in the squares.

Press any cross to cut the snake to this size and re-made your path.

The last cell of the path should be the bottom right corner.

When the snake's head is at the end of the path, the number of filled cells both
vertically and horizontally must match the numbers located next to the columns and rows.

You will have two attempts. If the second attempt also fails, the game will be over.
